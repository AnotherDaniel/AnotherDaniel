	<h2>Mac Keyboard</h2>

		<p>I’m probably going to have a trend in my Apple-related posts, where I’m going from mostly negative as I get used to things to more positive as I’m coming to grips with the system. So let’s get the biggest gripe out of the way first: the keyboard layout. I knew from afar that Apple has it’s own view on what a decent keyboard looks like - and I’m not talking about the touch bar. Ok so everybody’s to have their own special key, we know that. But there is a few things that I was not expecting.</p>

<h2 id="missing-keys">Missing keys</h2>

<p>I am completely dependent on basic navigation keys for moving around in documents, code, web pages etc - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PageUp</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PageDown</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Home</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">End</code> (let’s not even mention the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Delete</code> key). And ordering a 16” laptop I didn’t even think of the possibility that these keys might simply not be there. Ok, as this is Apple we’re talking about, these keys probable are nonexistent on any of their hardware. But why? Is this a design thing where “we can’t have too many keys, people would get confused!”?
The issue synergistically combines with these aggravating half-size cursor keys - because if you have to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Function</code>-cursor key combinations to substitute, then let’s make this workaround as fiddly as we possibly can? Looking at lists of keyboard shortcuts in MacOS, I get the impressions that the keyboard is actually a first-level citizen for interacting with the system. But for (cursor) navigation, you better bring small fingers and large amounts of patience.
This leads to the next item in my list:</p>

<h2 id="modifier-madness">Modifier madness</h2>

<p>On a standard PC keyboard we’ve got <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shift</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Alt</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Control</code> keys as often-used modifiers. Sometimes, seldomly, there’s that Windows key, which is not really that useful these days. So that is 3 relevant modifier keys.
On the Mac we have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shift</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Function</code> (needed because of missing basic navigation keys, see above), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Control</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Command</code>. That is 5 relevant modifier keys. Which are continually needed in various combinations for moving cursor, selecting text, moving between Desktops, switching application tabs, etc. Remembering and trial-erroring my way through this combinatorial jungle is not fun, and I’m not doing anything more than I used to on a Linux/Gnome system at this point. I mean I wanted to learn new stuff and don’t mind getting more dexterity on the small fingers of my left hand. But considering that by simply adding 4-5 fundamental keys <strong>that everyone else has as a matter of course</strong>, this wouldn’t even be worth mentioning - this feels like needless complexity.</p>

<h2 id="and-why-the-heck-cant-we-just-know-what-a-key-does">And why the heck can’t we just know what a key does?!</h2>

<p>Because constantly juggling 5-modifier-key-combos is not sufficient fun, there is an added twist to a Mac keyboard: all the special symbols that go beyond a very simplistic base set are there - somewhere. A Mac is a Unix system - but curly/angled brackets, pipe, tilde, backslash etc are simply not ‘mentioned’ anywhere on this keyboard. Things that are needed all the time in a terminal.
Of course they’re not in the same locations as everybody else’s keyboard, that would have been too easy. So I’m having to look this up in search engines, just to be able to interact with the shell and write code.
What is this supposed to achieve, keep the keyboard looking tidier? This is my first exposure to the hallowed Apple User Experience on one of their top-range products, and I am actually pissed.</p>
